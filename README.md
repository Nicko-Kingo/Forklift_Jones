## Overview:
        This game was made for a game design course at Virginia Tech. 
        Note that the overall structure and certain design practices (such as drawing the funcitons programmatically) as well as functionality were requirements for the assignment.
        This game was chosen as one of the best in a class of ~100 for that particular assignment, being showcased on the class' highlight reel. 

## About the Game:
        In this game you play as "Forklift Jones", your goal is to acquire all of the OSHA violations while crushing all of the evil PPE! 
        If you fail this task your forklift license will be taken away!

    This game is a parody, I do not condone violating OSHA recommendations or standards in any capacity.
